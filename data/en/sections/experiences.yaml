    responsibilities:
    I am a public transportation nerd! I have always been interested in beautiful giants, especially the ones in the form of buses, trains, and systems consisting of hundreds of them. Therefore, Siemens Mobility was the best kindergarden with nice toys to look at, and I had one of the most enjoyable internship experiences there.
    In my two-month intrenship, I developed an algorithm to solve a cable-packing problem to load trucks more efficiently. Then, I implemented that algorithm on Excel VBA and designed an Excel file in the form of a "Decision Support System." This little piece of software saved an expert's 10 hours a month, approximately.
