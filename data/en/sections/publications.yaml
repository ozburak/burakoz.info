  paper:
    summary: "In this century, climate change should be what we're talking and thinking about the most. I want to believe that we are getting there, albeit slowly. So my co-authors and I wanted to see how business education does in catching up with the changing needs of the humanity. In this literature review, we try to identify the IT-based teaching innovations that are used to introduce sustainability issues into business school classrooms. We identified that there is a need for a teaching innovation that integrates both sustainability and profit-oriented objectives in a realistic setting. One year after we published this literature review, we managed to publish the first version of 'ERPsim Logistics Sustainability' to address this identified need."

  paper:
    summary: "Does seeing an algorithm's suggestions constrain experts' thought process? Kahneman and Tversky's research studies shows that people stay under the influence of first impressions, which is defined as the 'anchoring effect.' The anchoring effect happens in professionals' interactions with decision aids, for example when they see an algorithm's sales forecasts. In this research, we designed an interesting online experiment to see if the anchoring bias can be mitigated. We designed two digital nudges -subtle design changes on the user interfaces- to counter the anchoring bias. Our results show that an informative digital nudge is effective in reducing anchoring bias and increasing decision performance, but only if users are technically knowledgeable in their field of work. In other words, digital nudges can be the solution for experienced and knowledgeable employees. However, for novices, training programs and other practices should be preferred instead of digital nudges."
