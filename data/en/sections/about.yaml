# a summary about you
summary: 'As an industrial engineer who is a tech-addict, I have always worked on increasing operational efficiency of organizations with the use of information technologies. I love thinking and communicating my thoughts in the form of business processes, conceptual maps, and algorithms. Currently, I am pursuing a PhD in information technologies to explore ways of making artificial intelligence more effective in making our life better. In my spare time, I cycle outdoors, or take on fun "homelab" projects using basic server tools.'
